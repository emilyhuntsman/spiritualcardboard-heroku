1. ask how to reload any page that it's on, do I have to make special navs for each? :( currently redirects to /prints
    send in route name to render, reference in partial with same variable in onclick button, use as req.params.route for redirect
2. also how to not close window on click of remove button
    ?? maybe later
3. pushing x currently deletes all copies
4. adding multiple should update quantity NOT add a second; want to decrement quant and if now zero, delete
    try storing array of objects with id, count; use to display with two buttons -/+; check first for existing 
5. ask specifically which routes to use get, put, 
delete etc when using mongoose methods
