# spiritual cardboard

### Intro and User Stories
My best friend Tommy has been drawing for years, and in the past few he's made an instagram account for his work, @spiritualcardboard which has been continuously gaining followers. He's constantly receiving DMs from people hoping to buy one of his prints, so he set up a basic shopify account. I love him to death but the site was a ruddy green which made its dark text hard to read, poorly aligned, and not optimized for the user experience (including a screenshot below). I decided to take a crack at remaking it, adding my code to the pre-existing shopify site.

Next:
2. also how to not close window on click of remove button
    ?? maybe later
3. pushing x currently deletes all copies
4. adding multiple should update quantity NOT add a second; want to decrement quant and if now zero, delete
    try storing array of objects with id, count; use to display with two buttons -/+; check first for existing ;  - 1 +

Priorities:
5. fix problem with formatting on delete
6. sketchpad, paint by numbers, caption contest (query button to add caption div)
7. fix where the queried div gets transformed to based on percentages of element
