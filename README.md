next: 
add to cart, delete from cart
display cart on /cart
display on dropdown menu
ask specifically which routes to use get, put, 
delete etc when using mongoose methods

sketchpad, paint by numbers

bugggg: adding multiple should update quantity NOT add a second
pushing x currently deletes all copies
want to derement quant and if now zero, delete

partials for nav, header, footer etc
fix width of dropdown
add price
make checkout look clickable on hover :)

need to reload page when the x is clicked, make new delete route there? since the other delete route redirects to the cart...

link css in partials
do edit, index, new, prints, showm, sketch
